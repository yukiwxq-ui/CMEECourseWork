## üß≠ Overview

In Week 1, we were introduced to the **UNIX operating system** and its modern implementation, **Linux (Ubuntu)** ‚Äî an essential environment for coding, data analysis, and high-performance computing.  
We learned about the UNIX philosophy, directory structures, the shell environment, basic terminal commands, and how to organise a project directory under version control.

## üß† Key Concepts Learned

### ‚öôÔ∏è What is UNIX?

- A **machine-independent**, **multi-user**, and **multi-tasking** operating system developed at AT&T in the 1970s.  
- Uses **plain text files**, a **hierarchical directory structure**, and **modular design** ‚Äî ideal for coding and automation.  
- **Linux** (and **Mac OS**) are UNIX-like systems; **Ubuntu** is the Linux distribution used for this course.

### Why UNIX?

- Free, open-source, stable, and secure.  
- Designed for programming, data management, and automation.  
- Forms the foundation for **HPC** (High Performance Computing) and bioinformatics workflows.

| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/dev` | Hardware device links |
| `/home` | User home directories |
